*************
High priority
*************
- Add automated testing
- Add "match" statement!

- Add an IO monad
- Add a system of traits
- Add a module system
- Add possibility for hidden arguments

************
Mid priority (as needed)
************
- Might consider allowing pattern matching through Data?
- Add destructuring Let statement
- Optimize expression contexts.
  - Probably faster to use shared_ptrs to avoid copying.
  - Can organize rules by their head.
  - Can add memoization (even possibly allow unique-ing of expressions)
  - Could refactor to a system of events and callbacks to avoid re-checking expressions when nothing's changed

************
Low priority
************
- Allow easy deduction of parts of rules - e.g. write unwrap _ (wrap _ x) = x.
- Revamp web interface
- Add other rules for equation solving
  - e.g. elimination of variables not held in common, expansion of tuple-like types,

- Archive generation should be more extensible - doesn't make sense to have internals of instruction.hpp in parser_tree.py
