Requires a context which can create new indeterminate variables.

O


SOLVER

Requires a context which can:
  1. Determine whether an expression is in the form VARIABLE ...args...
  2. Determine whether an expression is head-closed and, if so, list the head
     and arguments.
  3. Determine whether two expressions are judgmentally equal.
  4. Determine which arguments are present in an expression.

Produces output:
  1. Indicating if an external equation has been satisfied.
  2. Asserting the definition of a variable as a lambda.
  3. Requesting the creation of new indeterminate variables.

Accepts signals:
  1. Adding equations.
  2. Registering variables.
